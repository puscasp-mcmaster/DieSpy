## Login Guide:

1. Make sure you can get the app Running on Android Studio with an emulator.
2. Connect to a remote device (havent tried with a vm)
3. Open ```View > Tool Windows > Device Explorer```
4. Open ```com.diespy.app/files```
5. Paste the contents of this folder (i.e players folder, more to follow) into ```com.diespy.app/files```.
6. Run! For now, you can login with username "testuser" and password "password".

## Development Note:

The above is local app storage, which varies user by user. All user specific jsons will be kept there, including but not limited to: players, game sessions, statistics. Folder structure to follow later.
